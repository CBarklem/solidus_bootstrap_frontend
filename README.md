# solidus_bootstrap_frontend
Solidus frontend built on top of Bootstrap v4 (Currently in Alpha)

This is the start of the project. Please be patient.

The plan is to import the latest Bootstrap Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2 files. Port the bootstap views from Spree 3. Put it all together and build into a gem for all to share and more importantly TEST :)

Dependencies:
gem 'kaminari'
